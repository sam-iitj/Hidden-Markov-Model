# Hidden-Markov-Model

In this repository, I am implementing hidden markov model using the paper from https://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~stamp/RUA/HMM.pdf.
This python program generated a observation sequence using the brown dataset from the nltk package in python. The task is to apply HMM using some initial estimates of A, B and prior, and improving the loglikilihood of the observation using the current parameters of the model. I have implemented forward backward algorithm to estimate the alpha and beta parameters. I have also implemented a way to update the input perimeter values.
